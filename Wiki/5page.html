        <p>• Set up an ideal study environment. Study in a location that minimizes both visual and auditory distractions. Try to find a location where you cannot see others moving around and is located in a quiet space.</p>
        <p>• Remove unnecessary items from your study space that are not needed for studying.</p>
        <p>• Remove electronic distractions. Turn your phone on silent and put it where you cannot see the screen. Turn off notifications on your laptop.</p>
        <p>• Take timed breaks. Know your threshold for focus. When you start losing focus frequently, take a timed break. This will help to remind you to return to your studying.</p>
        <p>• Do not cram. Set a schedule to review material in a timely manner. List out specific goals/a study plan – even hour-by-hour, and use timers to try to stay on track.</p>
        <p>• Move around while studying. Get up and use a whiteboard or change positions often.</p>
        <p>• Chewing gum is sometimes helpful for focus, and/or having a stress ball or other fidget device can help when you start to feel restless.</p>
        <p>• Use mind mapping to help organize your thoughts and create a visual representation of the information.</p>
        <p>• Use highlighting or paraphrasing information as you read it.</p>
