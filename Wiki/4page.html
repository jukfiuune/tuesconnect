<h2>What is Anki?</h2>
<p>Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. 
  Because it's a lot more efficient than traditional study methods,
   you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying,
    or greatly increase the amount you learn.</p>

  <p>Anyone who needs to remember things in their daily life can
    benefit from Anki. Since it is content-agnostic and supports 
    images, audio, videos and scientific markup (via LaTeX), 
    the possibilities are endless.
    For example:</p>
  <p>-Learning a language</p>
  <p>-Studying for medical and law exams</p>
  <p>-Memorizing people's names and faces</p>
  <p>-Brushing up on geography</p>
  <p>-Mastering long poems</p>
  <p>-Even practicing guitar chords!</p>
